Try as much as possible to This is so important because chewing on stones or debris while eating is not a pleasant experience at all. Rinse out the Beans a couple of times and drain.</li><br>
    <li>Cook the beans: Pour the beans into a large pot. Add the peppers, onion, and smoked turkey wings. Cook until the Beans is very tender. This should take about 1 hour to 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. It will even cook faster if you use a pressure pot. The crockpot also works well.</li><br>
    <li>Stew and season the beans: Once the Beans are well cooked and soft remove the peppers, onion, and turkey from the beans. Blend the peppers and add back to the beans. Debone the turkey wing and cut it into bits and return that also to the beans. Add the salt, crayfish, seasoning powder, and palm oil. Stir well. Cover it up and leave to simmer for about 3 to 5 minutes and your Stewed Beans is ready!</li>
